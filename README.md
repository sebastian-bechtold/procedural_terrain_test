# procedural_terrain_test
A small and rudimentary experiment with procedural terrain generation using Perlin nouse and including water erosion simulation.

The implementation is based on a B.Sc. thesis I found online. Unfortunately I currently can't find it any more. I hope to find it again and add the URL here.
